format:
Radio			The generation of broadband cellular network technology (Eg. LTE, GSM)
MCC				Mobile country code. This info is publicly shared by International Telecommunication Union (link)
MNC				Mobile network code. This info is publicly shared by International Telecommunication Union (link)
LAC/TAC/NID		Location Area Code
CID				This is a unique number used to identify each Base transceiver station or "sector" of BTS
Longitude		Longitude, is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface
Longitude		Latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the Earth's surface.
Range			Approximate area within which the cell could be. (In meters)
Samples			Number of measures processed to get a particular data point
Changeable=1	The location is determined by processing samples
Changeable=0	The location is directly obtained from the telecom firm
Created			When a particular cell was first added to database (UNIX timestamp)
Updated			When a particular cell was last seen (UNIX timestamp)
AverageSignal	To get the positions of cells, OpenCelliD processes measurements from data contributors. 
				Each measurement includes GPS location of device + Scanned cell identifier (MCC-MNC-LAC-CID) + 
				Other device properties (Signal strength). In this process, signal strength of the device is averaged. 
				Most ‘averageSignal’ values are 0 because OpenCelliD simply didn’t receive signal strength values.
